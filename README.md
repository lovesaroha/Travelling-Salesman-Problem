# Travelling-Salesman-Problem (With Genetic Algorithm)
The travelling salesman problem (also called the travelling salesperson problem or TSP) asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?" It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in theoretical computer science and operations research.<br>
